        <h1>Hi, I'm Brad.</h1>
      
        <p>
          I am a backend software engineer with a passion for building products that have a positive impact on the world. I love identifying areas in the product or company that would greatly improve customer or employee experience. I have experience developing external and internal product features, developer tooling, and release tools in a startup environment. Most of the developer tooling (CI/CD, testing methodologies, API documentation) and release tooling (Jenkins, automation!) was inspired by breaking things myself, learning from my mistakes, finding time in the roadmap, and building guardrails to prevent myself or anyone else from making those mistakes again. Let's learn together!         
        </p>

          I am returning from a sabbatical where I was building a pet sitting <s>empire</s> business for myself. I absolutely loved pet sitting and it taught me a lot of valuable lessons around business management, budgeting, marketing, and I found myself developing tools that mimicked larger businesses. With that said, I am ready to re-enter the workforce refreshed and a deeper understanding of business and consumer needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Feel free to reach out via email, and if you have a cute pet, I'd love to see them!
