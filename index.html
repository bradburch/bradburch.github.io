        <h1>Hi, I'm Brad.</h1>
      
        <p>
          I am a backend software engineer with a passion for building products that have a positive impact on the world. I love identifying areas in the product or company that would greatly improve customer or employee experience. I have experience developing external and internal product features, developer tooling, and release tools in a startup environment. Most of the developer tooling (CI/CD, testing methodologies, API documentation) and release tooling (Jenkins, automation!) was inspired by breaking things myself, learning from my mistakes, finding time in the roadmap, and building guardrails to prevent myself or anyone else from making those mistakes again.

        <h2>There's a significant gap in your resume... What have you been up to for the past two years?</h2>
        
        <p>
          I was laid off at the start of the economic downturn in the tech field in 2022, and spent some of the first few months searching for new work, but I saw that the industry-wide hiring freeze wasn't going to end soon. I saw that I could either continue to invest all of my energy towards that goal, further deteriorating my mental, physical, and emotional health or I could look into other areas that would bring joy while the market corrected. That's what I've been doing since! I have been pet-sitting and dog-walking via <a href="https://www.rover.com/sit/bradb97628">Rover</a>, and exploring other interests. I've found a new community in birding and am more aware of the world around me. I have been keeping my feet wet in the tech industry by playing around with open-source software, investigating AI models on analyzing bird sounds, reading blog posts, books, and learning how technology and nature intertwine. It now looks like hiring is picking up, I am rejuvenated, and I am ready to get back to work!
